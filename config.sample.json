/**
 * Pick one of the following configurations	
 * based on your environment, fill out the 
 * remaining options and place into a config.json file.
 *
 * Leave appPath empty if your app is at the root of the host.
 * If path is included, omit the trailing slash. Any path that
 * follows that appPath should start with a slash to compensate.
 *
 * If you are using a proxy (usually on production), use proxyPort 
 * and set proxy to true. Otherwise (usually on development), make
 * sure you set both http and https and don't forget to provide paths
 * to your ssl key and certificate.
 *
 * Only use createUser the first time you run the app to
 * add the first user. After that, remove it from config.
